inbal@latitude:~/Desktop/assignment1$ cat smelly_cat.txt 
Smelly cat, smelly cat what are they feeding you?
Smelly cat, smelly cat it's not your fault.

They won't take you to the vet,
You're obviously not their favorite pet.
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat,
It's not your fault.

You may not be a bed of roses,
And you're no friend to those with noses.
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat,
It's not your fault.

I'll miss you before we're done
Or the world will smell as one
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat,
It's not your fault.

Smelly cat, smelly cat what are they feeding you?
Smelly cat, smelly cat it's not your fault!
inbal@latitude:~/Desktop/assignment1$ cat sticky_shoes.txt 
My favourite shoes so good to me
I wear them everyday
Down at the heel, holes in the toe
Don't care what people say
My feet's best friend, pals to the end
With them I'm one hot chicky
Though late one night
Not much light
I stepped in something icky
(Chorus)
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes
Always makes me smile
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes
Next time I'll avoid the pile
